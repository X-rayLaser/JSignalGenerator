JSignalGenerator
================

A small program designed to synthesize different frequency patterns. It is easy to create binaural beats with it.

To compile the program by means of jdk:
- clone the repository.
- run compile_file.bat.

To run the app:
- run launcher.bat

Done. :) Experiment with it and have fun!
